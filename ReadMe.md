# Neighborhood Map - Mohit Menghnani

This is one of the projects of the udacity front end nano degree program. I have developed a single page application featuring a map in the SF downtown neighborhood with some of my favorite places to visit. Each Place has a marker on the map. Clicking on the marker highlights the marker to a green color and opens an info window listing more details about the location(their website, phone number, and exact address. There is also a left navigation bar listing all the locations. Clicking on any of the locations from the list view also highlights the corresponding marker in the map.

There is a search functionality in the application. The listings in the list view and the markers update according to the filtering criteria entered in the search text box.

# API
The location data is being pulled from the foursquare API and the map is being generated using google maps API.
